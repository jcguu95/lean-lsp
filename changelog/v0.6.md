# Version 0.6

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-09

### Removed
- Decoupled the project from any specific agent workflow by removing `docs/AGENT_SETUP.md` and all Docker-related logic from `bin/test.sh`.

### Changed
- Clarified that installation instructions in `docs/INSTALLATION.md` are for macOS.
- Simplified `README.md` to focus on prerequisites and usage. Moved detailed setup, installation, and architecture information to `docs/INSTALLATION.md`.
- Further generalized `README.md` to focus on `lean-lsp`'s client-server architecture, removing specific references to the Docker/agent use-case.
- Refactored documentation to be more general. The main `README.md` now describes the `lean-lsp` tool, and agent-specific setup instructions have been moved to `docs/AGENT_SETUP.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-09

This release concludes the v0.5 series, which saw the agent successfully author a proof (`sum_of_first_n_odd_numbers`) from scratch and a significant refactoring of the repository. The goal for v0.6.x is to enable the agent to query and reference specific statements in `mathlib` by their exact location, not just by name.

### Changed
- Renamed `example-project` to `test-project` and moved it into `bin/` to better reflect its purpose.
- Made the `all` command in `lean-lsp` more resilient by handling failures in individual LSP requests.
- Moved `lean-lsp` and `test.sh` scripts into a `bin/` directory for better organization.
- Updated `project-1/test.sh` to verify proofs by building and checking for `sorry`, instead of using LSP hover commands.
- Refactored the main `test.sh` to be minimal and only test `test-project`.

### Added
- Created `project-1/test.sh` for a dedicated project-1 test suite.

### Fixed
- Fixed paths in `bin/test.sh` to be more robust after script locations changed.
- Scoped the `sorry` check in `project-1/test.sh` to only search project source files, not dependencies.
- Corrected relative paths to `lean-lsp` in `project-1/test.sh`.
- Restructured `project-1` to follow standard Lean library layout, fixing LSP analysis issues.
- Removed debug output from `test.sh`.
