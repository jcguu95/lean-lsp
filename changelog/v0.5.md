# Version 0.5

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Corrected the line and column numbers in `test.sh` for the `project-1` hover query to correctly target the theorem name.

### Changed
- Updated `SKILL.md` to reflect the current TCP-based client/server architecture.
- Clarified the role of the `lean-lsp` script as a wrapper for the Lean LSP server in `README.md` and the script's docstring.
- Updated `test.sh` to set up and run tests against both `example-project` and `project-1`.

### Added
- Created `project-1` and completed the proof for `sum_of_first_n_odd_numbers`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-09

This release establishes a stable, verifiable client-server architecture for interacting with the Lean LSP. The primary focus has been on creating a robust development and testing workflow that allows an agent within a Docker container to communicate with a Lean server running on the host machine.

The next phase of development (v0.5.x) will focus on leveraging this setup for the agent to begin writing and querying real proofs in Lean.

### Added
- Added a Docker-based test to `test.sh` to simulate and verify the agent's environment.
- Added `test.sh` for a "one-click" verification of the client-server setup.

### Changed
- Restructured `README.md` to guide new users to the verification script and document the full agent workflow.
- Aligned `test.sh` Docker command with the user's specific `lean-aider` environment.

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker test by overriding the container's entrypoint to correctly execute `lean-lsp`.
- Updated `test.sh` to run a host-only test by default, removing the need for Docker-specific hostnames and path configurations.
- Renamed `test-project` to `example-project` and included it in the repository to serve as a ready-to-use test case.
