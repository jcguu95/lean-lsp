# Version 0.3

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- Added path mapping flags (`--map-root-from`, `--map-root-to`) to support client/server running on different filesystems (e.g. Docker container and host).

### Changed
- Updated the test project to use a standard definition instead of `#check` to get more reliable hover info from the server.
- Updated `README.md` to include a `lake build` step to ensure dependencies are loaded by the server.
- Updated `README.md` with more robust instructions for downloading dependencies and using the `mathlib` cache.
- Updated `README.md` to clarify that client commands must be run from the project root.
- Added `mathlib` as a dependency to the test project.
- Updated test project to import and check a `mathlib` definition.

### Fixed
- Updated `README.md` and `test-project/lakefile.toml` with correct dependency syntax (`[[require]]`) and `mathlib` cache command (`lake exe mathlib/cache get`) based on troubleshooting with Lake v5.0.0.
