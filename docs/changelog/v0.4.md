# Version 0.4

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- Achieved stable client-server communication between the agent in a Docker container and the Lean LSP server on the host machine.

### Fixed
- Corrected the `mathlib` import in the test project to point to a specific file (`Prime.Basic`) instead of a directory module.
- Improved path-mapping logic to be more robust by using string operations instead of filesystem-dependent path resolution.
