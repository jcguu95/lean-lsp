# Version 0.2

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- Added validation to ensure the `start` command is run from a Lean project directory.
- Added more detailed instructions to `README.md` on how to create a Lean project and run the server from it.
- Added installation instructions for setting up the LEAN toolchain on macOS to `README.md`.
- Added a `--verbose` flag to the `start` command to show daemon logs for debugging.

### Fixed
- The `start` command now provides feedback that it is starting, instead of hanging silently.
- Fixed a bug where the daemon process was spawned with incorrect argument order, causing a crash.
